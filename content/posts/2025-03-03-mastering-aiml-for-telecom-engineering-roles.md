I'd be happy to help you prepare for a Staff-level AI/ML engineering role! Let's create a structured learning path that takes you from fundamentals to advanced concepts, with a focus on telecom industry applications.
AI/ML Learning Path for a Telecom Engineer
Foundations (2-4 weeks)

Mathematics: Linear algebra, calculus, probability, and statistics
Programming: Python, data structures, algorithms
ML Basics: Supervised vs. unsupervised learning, training/testing methodology
Data Processing: Data cleaning, feature engineering, normalization

Core ML Concepts (4-6 weeks)

Classical Algorithms: Linear/logistic regression, decision trees, SVMs, k-means
Neural Networks: Fundamentals, backpropagation, activation functions
Deep Learning: CNNs, RNNs, transformers, attention mechanisms
Evaluation: Precision, recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC, confusion matrices

Advanced Topics (6-8 weeks)

NLP: Word embeddings, BERT, GPT architectures, text classification
MLOps: Model versioning, CI/CD for ML, monitoring
Distributed Training: Parameter servers, data parallelism
Model Optimization: Pruning, quantization, distillation

Telecom-Specific Applications

Network traffic prediction and anomaly detection
Customer churn prediction
Network optimization using reinforcement learning
Predictive maintenance for telecom infrastructure
Spectrum management optimization
